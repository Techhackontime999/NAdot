# Delete Post Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented delete post functionality with a 3-dot menu that appears only for post owners.

## Features Implemented

### 1. 3-Dot Menu (Post Options) ✅

#### UI/UX
- **Menu Button**: Three vertical dots icon in post header
- **Visibility**: Only visible to post owner (not shown for other users' posts)
- **Dropdown Menu**: Appears on click with delete option
- **Click Outside**: Menu closes when clicking anywhere outside
- **Multiple Posts**: Each post has its own independent menu

#### Visual Design
- Clean dropdown with shadow and border
- Red text and hover effect for delete option
- Trash icon next to "Delete Post" text
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 2. Delete Post Functionality ✅

#### Frontend
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Browser confirm dialog before deletion
- **AJAX Request**: Deletes post without page reload (on feed page)
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Post card fades out with scale animation
  - Success message appears (green notification)
  - Message auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- **Redirect**: On post detail page, redirects to feed after deletion

#### Backend
- **New View**: `delete_post(post_id)` - POST endpoint to delete posts
- **Authorization**: Verifies user owns the post before deletion
- **Security**: Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't own post
- **Cascade Delete**: Automatically deletes associated comments and likes

#### Security Features
- Login required for all delete operations
- Ownership verification on server-side
- CSRF protection on POST requests
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 403, 400)
- Cannot delete via GET request

## API Endpoint

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| `/post/<post_id>/delete/` | POST | Delete a post | Owner only |

### Response Codes
- `200` - Success (post deleted)
- `403` - Forbidden (not post owner)
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid method)
- `404` - Not Found (post doesn't exist)

## User Flow

### On Feed Page
1. User sees their own post
2. 3-dot menu button appears in post header
3. User clicks 3-dot button
4. Dropdown menu appears with "Delete Post" option
5. User clicks "Delete Post"
6. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete this post? This action cannot be undone."
7. User confirms deletion
8. Post fades out with animation
9. Post is removed from DOM
10. Success message appears: "Post deleted successfully"
11. Message disappears after 3 seconds

### On Post Detail Page
1. User views their own post detail page
2. 3-dot menu button appears in post header
3. User clicks 3-dot button
4. Dropdown menu appears with "Delete Post" option
5. User clicks "Delete Post"
6. Confirmation dialog appears
7. User confirms deletion
8. Page redirects to feed
9. Post is deleted from database

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Features
- Event delegation for dynamic content
- Click outside detection to close menus
- AJAX for seamless deletion on feed
- DOM manipulation for animations
- Confirmation dialog for safety
- Success notification system

### CSS/Styling
- Dropdown positioned absolutely
- Z-index for proper layering
- Smooth opacity and scale transitions
- Responsive design maintained
- Hover effects for better UX

### Database
- Cascade deletion of related objects:
  - Comments on the post
  - Likes on the post
  - Post image file (if exists)

## Files Modified

### Views
- `NAdot/feed/views.py` - Added `delete_post` view

### URLs
- `NAdot/feed/urls.py` - Added delete endpoint

### Templates
- `NAdot/feed/templates/feed/index.html` - Added menu and delete UI
- `NAdot/feed/templates/feed/post_detail.html` - Added menu and delete UI

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created `test_delete_post.py` with comprehensive tests:

✅ **All Tests Passed:**
- Users can delete their own posts
- Posts are removed from database
- Users cannot delete other users' posts
- Proper HTTP status codes returned
- Authorization checks working
- GET requests properly rejected

### Test Results
```
✓ User can delete their own post
✓ Post removed from database
✓ User cannot delete another user's post (403 Forbidden)
✓ Post still exists after unauthorized delete attempt
✓ GET request to delete endpoint returns 400
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- Server-side ownership verification
- Cannot bypass with client-side manipulation
- Proper error messages without leaking info

### Data Integrity
- Cascade deletion prevents orphaned records
- Transaction safety (Django ORM handles this)
- No partial deletions

### User Experience
- Confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- Clear feedback on success/failure
- Graceful error handling

## UI States

### Menu States
```
Closed (Default):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ @username · 2 hours ago  ⋮  │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Open (After Click):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ @username · 2 hours ago  ⋮  │
│                    ┌────────┤
│                    │ 🗑️ Delete Post
│                    └────────┤
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Deletion Flow
```
1. Normal Post
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Post Content    │
   │ [Like] [Comment]│
   └─────────────────┘

2. Confirmation
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ Are you sure you want to    │
   │ delete this post?           │
   │ [Cancel] [OK]               │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

3. Deleting (Animation)
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Post Content    │ ← Fading out
   │ [Like] [Comment]│ ← Scaling down
   └─────────────────┘

4. Success Message
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ ✓ Post deleted successfully │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
```
