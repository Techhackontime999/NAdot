### v1.2.0 — February 8, 2026

---

### v1.1.0 — February 6, 2026

**Real-time messaging fix:**

Resolved critical WebSocket event handling issues preventing real-time message display in chat. Messages were only appearing after a page refresh.

**Root cause:** Django Channels WebSocket consumers were missing handlers for several event types — `multi_tab_sync`, `notification_message`, `user_status`, `read_receipt_update`, and `badge_update` — causing `ValueError: No handler for message type X` and connection drops.

**Fix:** Added all missing event handlers to both `ChatConsumer` and `NotificationsConsumer` in `nadot/messaging/consumers.py` (+60 lines).

**Impact:**
- Messages now appear instantly for both sender and receiver
- No more WebSocket connection drops
- Cross-tab synchronization, read receipts, and badge updates all functioning correctly

---
