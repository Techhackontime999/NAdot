# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for preparing the Django NAdot project (a LinkedIn clone) for production deployment. The system currently runs in development mode with SQLite and needs to be transformed into a production-ready application with PostgreSQL, proper security configurations, environment-based settings, and deployment readiness for platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, or similar cloud providers.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Django NAdot application and its deployment configuration
- **Production_Environment**: The live server environment where the application will be deployed
- **Development_Environment**: The local development environment used by developers
- **Environment_Variable**: Configuration values stored outside the codebase for security and flexibility
- **Static_Files**: CSS, JavaScript, and image files served by the application
- **Media_Files**: User-uploaded content (profile pictures, post images, etc.)
- **Channel_Layer**: Django Channels backend for WebSocket communication
- **WSGI_Server**: Web Server Gateway Interface server (e.g., Gunicorn) for serving the application
- **ASGI_Server**: Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface server (e.g., Daphne) for WebSocket support
- **Database_Migration**: Process of switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- **Secret_Key**: Django's cryptographic signing key for security features
- **CSRF_Token**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection token
- **Sensitive_Data**: Information that should not be committed to version control (passwords, API keys, secret keys)
